BUILDING PORTAUDIO

Just use cmake:

$ cmake
$ make
# make install

BUILDING ON WINDOWS USING VISUAL STUDIO

Modern versions of Visual Studio have native CMake support, which should work
out-of-the-box. Simply open the CMakeLists.txt file in Visual Studio and hit
build.

BUILDING ON WINDOWS USING mingw-w64

Starting from a fresh, up-to-date msys2 install:

$ pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-cmake make mingw-w64-i686-gcc
$ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles"
$ make

CROSS-COMPILING FROM DEBIAN TO WINDOWS USING mingw-w64

# apt-get install cmake make mingw-w64 mingw-w64-tools

You will need to write a CMake toolchain file with the following contents:

  SET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)
  SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-gcc)
  SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER i686-w64-mingw32-g++)

Then:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/toolchain/file
$ make
